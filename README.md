# Business DS
Examples from [Business Data Science](https://www.amazon.com/Business-Data-Science-Combining-Accelerate/dp/1260452778).  Data and R scripts are in the `examples` directory.  

You can open issues on this repository to report any typos or errors in the book or to ask or answer questions about the material (and thanks for doing so!!).  Please feel encouraged to fork the repository, improve the examples, and submit pull requests.  I greatly appreciated any contributions that make the material easier to understand (and remove errors).

For those using this book for teaching, my old course materials from Chicago Booth are at https://github.com/TaddyLab/MBAcourse.
